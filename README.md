## Overview
`Student Searcher` is a full-stack web application for managing student records. Originally a Python-based command-line tool, it has been enhanced with a Flask backend and a React frontend, deployed on Render and Vercel. Users can view, search, manage, and analyze student data through an intuitive web interface, with data persisted in a text file (`students.txt`).

## Features
- **View All Students:** Display all students in a table with names, grades, and average grades on the Home page.
- **Search by Name (Exact Match):** Search for a student by their exact name (case-insensitive) via the Search page.
- **Search by Partial Name:** Find students whose names contain a substring (case-insensitive) on the Search page.
- **Search by Average Grade Range:** Find students with average grades in a specified range on the Search page.
- **Add a Student:** Add a new student with validated name and grades through the Manage page.
- **Remove a Student:** Remove a student with confirmation on the Manage page.
- **Edit a Student's Grades:** Update a studentâ€™s grades on the Manage page.
- **Display Class Statistics:** Show class average, highest average grade, and lowest average grade, with corresponding students, on the Stats page.
- **Data Persistence:** Save student data to `students.txt` on the server, updated automatically after add/edit/remove actions.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures names contain only letters and spaces, grades are numbers between 0 and 100, and API inputs are valid.

## Technologies
- **Backend**:
  - **Python**: Core programming language for the backend logic.
  - **Flask**: Web framework for the RESTful API, handling routes and requests.
  - **Flask-CORS**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication.
  - **Gunicorn**: WSGI server for deploying the Flask app on Render.
- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
  - **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
  - **Create React App**: Boilerplate for setting up the React project.
- **Deployment**:
  - **Render**: Hosts the Flask backend at `https://student-searcher-backend.onrender.com`.
  - **Vercel**: Hosts the React frontend at `https://student-searcher.vercel.app`.
  - **GitHub**: Version control and source code hosting.
- **File I/O**:
  - Text file (`students.txt`) for persistent data storage on the server.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Access the Web App**:
   - Visit **View Live Demo: [https://student-searcher.vercel.app/](https://student-searcher.vercel.app/)** in a browser.
   - Navigate using the menu:
     - **Home**: View all students.
     - **Search**: Search by name (exact or partial) or grade range.
     - **Manage**: Add, edit, or remove students.
     - **Stats**: View class statistics.

2. **Interact with Features**:
   - **Search**: Enter a name or grade range in the Search page form.
   - **Manage**: Use forms to add a new student (name, comma-separated grades), edit grades, or remove a student.
   - **Stats**: View class average, highest, and lowest grades automatically.

3. **Input Requirements**:
   - **Names**: Must contain only letters and spaces (e.g., "John Doe").
   - **Grades**: Must be comma-separated numbers between 0 and 100 (e.g., "86,90,95").
